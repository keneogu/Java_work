Assume that a gallon of paint covers about 350 square feet of wall space. Create an application with a main() method that prompts the user for the length, width, and height of a rectangular room. Pass these three values to a method that does the following:

calculate():int
This method will call the other methods to complete the overall cost calculation and the other calculations needed to accomplish this.
calculateArea():int method functionality:

Calculates the wall area for a room

How do you calculate the area of the four walls of a room? Suggest doing some desk checking and be sure to understand this before coding.

calculatePaintNeeded(): double
Uses the calculated wall area to determine the number of gallons of paint needed.
Remember a gallon covers 350 square feet.
calculateCost(): double
Computes the price based on a paint price of $32 per gallon,

assuming that the painter can buy any fraction of a gallon of paint at the same price as a whole gallon (ie. 1.5 gallons would cost 32*1.5).

Returns the price to be assigned to a variable in the main() method

getInformation(): void
This method will ask the user for the job details.
display: void
This will output the details to the console
toString(): String
This will format the output to be shown when displaying a paint job.
The main() method displays the final price. For example, the cost to paint a 15- by-20-foot room with 10-foot ceilings is $64.
