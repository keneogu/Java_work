Situation: The Concert Band of PEI is looking for a program that will allow its ticket office to calculate the cost of ticket group purchases based on seat location. A group may purchase from one or all seat types in one transaction. Your program must allow the ticket office clerk to enter many seats for each type a group wishes to purchase (even if zero ticket is purchased from a type), once the information entered it should calculate: 1. the total cost of all tickets, and 2. the average cost of seats based on the user's order.

Seat cost:
Orchestra $ 25.00,
Main Floor $ 30.00,
Balcony $ 15.00

Notes
Constants should be used
Ask for inputs one at a time, number of orchestra seats then main floor, then balcony.
Store in separate variables.
Use a method in your solution (other than the main method).
