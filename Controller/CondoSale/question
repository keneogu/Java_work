Condo Sales Application

Write an application for the Summerdale Condo Sales office; the program determines the price of a condominium.

Ask the user to choose 1 for park view, 2 for golf course view, or 3 for lake view. Park view condos are $150,000,
condos with golf course views are $170,000, and condos with lake views are $210,000.
If the user enters an invalid code, set the price to 0.&nbsp;

If the condo view selection is valid, add a prompt to the CondoSales application to ask the user to specify:

garage (yes/no)
parking space (yes/no).
Add $5,000 to the price of any condo with a garage.
Add $1000 to the pirce of any condo with a parking spot&nbsp;
The output is the name of the chosen view, garage option, parking option and the price of the condo.
